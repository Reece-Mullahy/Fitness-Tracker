# Fitness-Tracker
This project allows a user to enter fitness stats for each day throughout the week. The type of stats include: total time, protein,
muscles worked, cardio time, and any notes for the day. The input is saved and displayed each time the tracker is opened up.

A second page allows a user to enter in quantitative fitness goals for three different categories. These categories are daily averages
for total time, protein consumes, and time spent on cardio. These goals are displayed in the form of daily averages and weekly totals
and the data entered from the tracker is used to compare how well user is performing on their goals in these two parameters.

This page also includes two graphs for each category of performance. The daily average graph shows how far above or below a user
is on the goal set. The graph that demonstrates progress on weekly totals shows how much progress the user has made on the goal as a 
percent.
